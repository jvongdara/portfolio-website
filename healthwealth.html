            <p>Usability test plans, conducting test, and A&B preferencing test were conducted numerous times while making these diagrams, user personas, sitemaps, and all three stages of wireframes. This goes to show when involving participants to share their thoughts on these designs, their feedback can change your design iterations as a whole to help reach the users needs and goals as a fitness and health application. </p>
             <h3> Problem Statement </h3>
             <p>Many users show an interest in becoming more healthy but does not know where to start. Fitness users need a space to explore, motivate, and commit to they routines to further their fitness goals. When new users are given guidance on where to start from the beginning of the experience, they are less likely to lose interest in their fitness journey. This is also true for experienced fitness users who need a safe space to provide all their needs within a workout app.</p>
             <h3> Our Statement </h3>
             <p>How might we make fitness users, new and experienced, be interested in using an fitness application?
                    The Health-Wealth app enhances the learning process and exposure to new and beneficial exercises for all users. Users set their own personal health goals and track progress towards those goals. This will make it easier for users to monitor progress, and create a fitness routine. The Health-Wealth application provides a user friendly space where all who uses the app can explore, engage, and get motivated to develop healthier interest and habits for themselves.</p>

                These user personals are will help us keep the users goals in mind when creating the fidelity wireframes to come.</p>

                <h3>From Sitemap to Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Over time, The Health-Wealth app design approach has evolved significantly. The vision and goal for this app is to help those who struggle with staying consistent with their workout or training routine. The users needs a way to help improve their physical and mental wellbeing along with trying to balance their busy schedule, The Health-Wealth app will help users find confidence and consistency within themselves. Designing an engaging and helpful application for users to log and find quick solutions to their fitness problems resulting in quicker results. With this goal in mind, I conducted surveys, interviews, and competitive analyses to gain a deeper understanding of our users needs and preferences. With the qualitative research as a guiding framework, I proceeded to develop wireframes and prototypes at various fidelity levels from low to high. Each iteration brought new learnings and lead to a more user-centered solution for our target audience. The following pages are key examples of the design iteration process through the creation of The Health-Wealth application. </p>
                <h2> Low Fidelity </h2>
                <img src="img/uidesign_lowfidelity.svg" alt="lowfidelity"> 

                <h2> Mid Fidelity (1&2) </h2>
                <p>From our low-fidelity to mid-fidelity wireframes, I was able to transfer the design to from paper to digital. This made the idea come to life, adding more of a structure and guide to the pages and wireframes.Creating 2 mid-fidelity wireframes helped this process a lot by always improving and building off the design to further reach the users goals and increate the efficiently in the user experience as an app. Additional user testing was taken in between mid fidelity 1 & 2 to improve the designs.</p>
                <img src="img/uidesign_midfidelity.svg" alt="midfidelity"> 


                <h2> High Fidelity </h2>
                <p>From our mid-fidelity to high-fidelity wireframes, i was able to design and implement the fine detail within the app and final wireframes. This included text hierarchy, grid layout margins, and designed a whole Health-Wealth design language to follow. The design language guideline consist of an everyday use that aims to be judgement free and supportive in users health journey. The app should provide motivation and guidance to the users. No harsh UI elements, very welcoming & friendly tone always once opening the app. Additional user testing was taken in between the mid fidelity and high-fidelity to improve the designs.</p>

                <h2> UI Elements and Components </h2>
                <p>Health-Wealth iconography is intuitive and recognizable, making it easy to quickly understand actions and features and enhancing the user experience.  Our reusable UI Components include navigation, buttons, drop-down menus, and input text fields that are designed to promote user interaction and efficiency for the Health-Wealth platform. </p>
